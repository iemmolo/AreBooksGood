This book makes me feel stressed, anxious, hopeful, and optimistic. It touches on such well-trod concepts from a really unique and refreshing angle. I found the relationships in this book to be quite powerful and was continually impressed with the writing.

One of my favorite things about this book is how clever it makes me feel. As I listened to this as an audiobook, I'm not sure if this will translate over to the physical book, but listening to Ray Porter explaining science made me feel like I knew science. Very similar to how Andy Weir's other book The Martian made me feel. I think that's just a testament to how well the science is written.

If you can, please read this book before you see the movie and don't watch any trailers. Hopefully the book translates to a good movie.
