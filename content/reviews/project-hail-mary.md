Andy Weir does one thing extremely well: he writes characters who solve problems with science, and he makes it thrilling.

Project Hail Mary is The Martian in space. Ryland Grace wakes up on a ship with no memory, two dead crewmates, and a mission to save humanity from an organism eating our sun. What follows is a series of increasingly creative problem-solving sequences that are genuinely fun to read.

The real heart of the book, though, is Rocky. Without spoiling too much: Grace meets someone, and their relationship becomes the best part of the story. It's funny, it's warm, and it earns its emotional payoff.

The weaknesses are there if you look. The Earth-based flashback chapters drag. Some of the science explanations run long. And Weir's prose is functional, not beautiful — you're here for the puzzle-solving, not the sentences.

But when the puzzles are this good and the stakes are this high, who cares? This book is good.
