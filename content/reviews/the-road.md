summary: "A father and son walk through ash. McCarthy strips language down to its bones and somehow makes it more powerful."
---

There's not much plot to describe. A man and his son push a shopping cart through a dead world, heading south. They're hungry. They're cold. They're afraid.

And yet this is one of the most powerful novels I've ever read.

McCarthy's prose here is skeletal. Short sentences. No quotation marks. Paragraphs that hit like punches. He doesn't tell you what happened to the world and it doesn't matter. What matters is the conversation between a father who remembers the old world and a son who never knew it.

> He held the boy close to him. So thin. My heart, he said. My heart.

The kid is the moral compass. He wants to help everyone. The father can't afford to. That tension is the entire book.

Some people will find this bleak beyond tolerance. I get it. But beneath the ash there's something burning — the idea that carrying love forward is the only thing that matters, even when everything else is gone.

Yes, this book is good.
