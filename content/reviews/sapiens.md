Sapiens tries to tell the entire story of humanity in 400 pages. That's either ambitious or reckless, depending on your tolerance for sweeping generalizations.

Harari is a good writer. The chapter on the Agricultural Revolution as "history's biggest fraud" is genuinely thought-provoking. The idea that we didn't domesticate wheat — wheat domesticated us — sticks with you.

But the further the book goes, the thinner it stretches. By the time you hit the chapters on capitalism and happiness, you're reading confident claims backed by not much evidence. Harari presents contested ideas as settled facts, and that's a problem if you're reading this as history rather than philosophy.

Still, as a book that makes you *think* about the big picture — how did we get here, and was it worth it? — it works. Just don't mistake it for the final word on any of these topics.

This book is okay.
