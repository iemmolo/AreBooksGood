I love this series so much.

I don't know if it's the constant numbers going up, the MC always being able to win no matter the circumstances, or just the comforting voice of Travis Baldree, but I can see myself reading well over 20 books in this series.

I could see a lot of people hating the aspects that I love in this book. Your positives might be my negatives and vice versa.

Zogarth has managed to create (for me at least) a relatable MC who shares the same systematic approach to progression while balancing a healthy amount of obsessive, unwavering dedication (often at our own peril) to a goal or objective that most people would find pointless or a waste of time. Sometimes the journey is the point and the destination a nice bonus.

If you like slice-of-life pacing with a progression power fantasy story containing isekai elements, then this LitRPG book might be for you.
