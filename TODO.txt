AreBooksGood - Improvement TODO
=================================

## Critical

- [ ] Add missing front matter to that review: summary, narrator
- [ ] Clean stale build artifacts (public/reviews/sapiens/, public/reviews/the-road/)
- [x] Add ARIA labels to rating partial for screen reader accessibility

## High Priority

- [x] Add a custom 404 page template
- [x] Remove commented-out code in home.html (line 4)
- [x] Add skip-to-main-content link for accessibility

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Add responsive breakpoints for tablet (768px) and larger screens
- [ ] Add preconnect hint for font CDN to improve load performance
- [ ] Add reading time metadata to reviews
- [ ] Optimize images (WebP with JPEG fallback)

## Pet System Quick Wins

### High Impact
- [ ] Add PetSprites.renderPreview() — shop calls it but it's undefined, falls back to ASCII art. ~50 lines reusing box-shadow technique from pet.js
- [ ] Add level-up animation — evolution completes silently, needs flash/pulse CSS keyframe + JS trigger
- [ ] Increase fling coin rewards — currently 1-5 coins but evolution costs 2000+. Scale to 5-15 or velocity-based (1-line change in pet.js:507)

### Bug Fixes
- [x] Fix idle speech interval leak — store setInterval handle, clear on re-entry
- [x] Save pet position on drag end — was only saving on fling release
- [x] Increase walk settle timer from 300ms to 500ms for smoother transition
- [x] Increase fling coin rewards from 1-5 to 5-15

### Polish
- [ ] Add aria-live="polite" to speech bubbles for screen readers (pet.js:769)
- [ ] Add tooltip on disabled evolution button showing what's missing (coins vs games watched)
