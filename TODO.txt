AreBooksGood - Improvement TODO
=================================

## Critical

- [ ] Complete "The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August" review (ends mid-sentence)
- [ ] Add missing front matter to that review: summary, narrator
- [ ] Clean stale build artifacts (public/reviews/sapiens/, public/reviews/the-road/)
- [x] Add ARIA labels to rating partial for screen reader accessibility

## High Priority

- [x] Add a custom 404 page template
- [x] Remove commented-out code in home.html (line 4)
- [x] Add skip-to-main-content link for accessibility

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Add responsive breakpoints for tablet (768px) and larger screens
- [ ] Add preconnect hint for font CDN to improve load performance
- [ ] Add reading time metadata to reviews
- [ ] Optimize images (WebP with JPEG fallback)

## Pet System Quick Wins

### High Impact
- [ ] Add PetSprites.renderPreview() — shop calls it but it's undefined, falls back to ASCII art. ~50 lines reusing box-shadow technique from pet.js
- [ ] Add level-up animation — evolution completes silently, needs flash/pulse CSS keyframe + JS trigger
- [ ] Increase fling coin rewards — currently 1-5 coins but evolution costs 2000+. Scale to 5-15 or velocity-based (1-line change in pet.js:507)

### Bug Fixes
- [x] Fix idle speech interval leak — store setInterval handle, clear on re-entry
- [x] Save pet position on drag end — was only saving on fling release
- [x] Increase walk settle timer from 300ms to 500ms for smoother transition
- [x] Increase fling coin rewards from 1-5 to 5-15

### Polish
- [ ] Add aria-live="polite" to speech bubbles for screen readers (pet.js:769)
- [ ] Add tooltip on disabled evolution button showing what's missing (coins vs games watched)

## Farm System

### Phase 1 (Done)
- [x] JB wallet module (jackbucks.js)
- [x] Farm bar with 2 plots, 3 starter crops, timestamp growth, harvest for JB
- [x] JB display in header wallet widget

### Phase 2: Pet Farming AI
- [ ] Add autonomous walk-to-plot behavior on idle timer (every 20-30s)
- [ ] Add pet harvesting interaction (walk to plot → celebrate → collect)
- [ ] Add per-pet farming bonuses (cat: auto-replant 15%, dragon: +10% grow speed, robot: auto-harvest)
- [ ] Add farm-specific speech lines per pet type
- [ ] Add harvest particle effects (crop icon floats up)

### Phase 3: Silk Road Store & Farmhouse
- [ ] Create Silk Road page layout with terminal black-market aesthetic
- [ ] Implement seed purchasing → inventory system
- [ ] Add common crops (tomato, corn, pumpkin) and rare crops (golden apple, crystal herb, dragon fruit)
- [ ] Add plot expansion upgrade (max 6 plots)
- [ ] Add upgrades: sprinkler, fertilizer, scarecrow, golden trowel, seed bag
- [ ] Add merchant dialogue system
- [ ] Add farmhouse (pixel-art, 5 upgrade levels, bonuses)
- [ ] Add exclusive cosmetics (farmer hat, dirt trail, overgrown theme, harvest moon)

## Low Priority / Nice-to-Have

- [ ] Add search functionality (Pagefind or Lunr.js)
- [ ] Add related reviews section on each review page
- [ ] Add Goodreads/external links for each book
- [ ] Reduce favicon size (currently 15KB)
